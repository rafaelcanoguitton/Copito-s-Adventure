# Copito's Adventure

<img title="" align="left" src="IMG_1168.PNG" alt="" width="271" style="float: left;">This repository contains the Computer Human Interaction (**CS2H1**) class at ***Universidad Católica San Pablo's*** semester assignment. The core of the assignment is to implement an application/game which makes use of concepts and topics reviewed in class.

Our approach was to make an isometric low-ply style game that could be played using voice controls and used Augmented Reality. We considered gameplay, enemies, items, level progression and many other concepts.
